## Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

This Git Repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms. All the algorithms are written by me by following the Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning using the following Libraries of Python:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

As of today, i.e., December 11, 2022, following algorithms are present:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (Classification Problems)
- Gradient Descent Algorithm
